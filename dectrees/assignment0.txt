MONK-1: Difficult due to comparision between a1 and a2
MONK-2: Difficult due to simultaneous comparison between Attributes
MONK-3: Difficult due to multiple conditions satisfied at once (+ Noise)

MONK-2 should be the most difficult, since it has the most simultaneous
comparison between Attributes, which is something that typically
requires more than a binary split
