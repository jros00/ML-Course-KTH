In machine learning, the bias-variance trade-off is a critical concept that 
helps us understand the performance of a model on unseen data. 

A model with high bias is too simplistic; it doesn't capture the complexities of the data, 
leading to underfitting and poor generalization. 

On the other hand, a model with high variance is too complex; 
it captures the noise in the training data, leading to overfitting and 
poor performance on new data.

Decision trees, particularly deep ones, are naturally prone to high variance and low bias. 
They capture the minute details of the training data, but this makes them less capable of 
generalizing to new, unseen data. Essentially, while they perform exceptionally well on the 
training set, their performance drops significantly on the test set. 

In this state, they are said to have a high variance but low bias.

Pruning comes into play here as a technique to move the model towards a 
better bias-variance trade-off. 

By trimming down the tree's branches, pruning simplifies the overly complex model, 
thereby increasing its bias marginally but significantly reducing its variance. 

The idea is to remove as much of the tree's complexity as possible without 
sacrificing too much predictive power, effectively finding a balanced middle ground. 

Here's how pruning impacts the trade-off:

1. Increasing Bias: 
        When we prune, we're making the model simpler, thus introducing a bit more bias. 
        However, the goal is to do this in a controlled way so that we're only 
        eliminating the 'extra complexity' that contributes to overfitting but 
        doesn't really help the model's predictive power.

2. Reducing Variance: 
        Pruning a decision tree helps to lower its sensitivity to the fluctuations in the 
        training data, thus reducing its variance. 
        This is crucial for improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

So, in summary, pruning is an essential technique for achieving a good bias-variance 
trade-off in decision trees. By carefully removing some of the tree's branches, 
you increase bias slightly but can dramatically reduce variance, 
resulting in a model that is more robust and performs better on unseen data.
